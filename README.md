A feature-rich solution for bundled Chrome extensions! üíØ

Build Chrome extensions using
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), with
[minimal configuration](#usage).

Use `manifest.json` as the input. Every file in the manifest will
be bundled or copied to the output folder.

## Getting started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Chrome Extension Boilerplates

[Javascript-boilerplate](https://github.com/extend-chrome/javascript-boilerplate)

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Create a `rollup.config.js` file in your project root.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve'
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs'

import {
  chromeExtension,
  simpleReloader,
} from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

export default {
  input: 'src/manifest.json',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
  },
  plugins: [
    // always put chromeExtension() before other plugins
    chromeExtension(),
    simpleReloader(),
    // the plugins below are optional
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
  ],
}
```

Add these scripts to your `package.json` file.

```jsonc
// package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c",
    "watch": "rollup -c -w"
  }
}
```

Put your Chrome extension source code in a folder named `src` in
the root of your project and build with the following command:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Your extension build will be in the `dist` folder. It has
everything it needs: manifest, scripts, and assets (images, css,
etc...).

Load it in Chrome `chrome://extensions/` to test drive your extension! üöó

## Features <a name = "features"></a>

###  ‚≠êÔ∏è It's all in the Manifest <a name = "features-manifest"></a>
<div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 10px;">

<details>
<summary>Why does the rollup.config.js only need the manifest as an entry point?</summary>
<br>
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` parses your manifest and bundles the scripts in your background page, content scripts, option page and popup page
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does that include the scripts in the Options page and Popup page?</summary>
<br>
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` uses the JS or even TS files in
your HTML files as entry points. Shared code is split out into
chunks automatically, so libraries like React and Lodash aren't
bundled into your extension multiple times.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens with the assets? Like images, icons or css files?</summary>
<br>
All assets in the manifest (images, icons, and even CSS files) are automatically copied into the output folder. Even the images in your HTML files get copied over. NOTE: This only includes assets in the html. If you import a css file in a javascript file, you will need an additional plugin. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is the Manifest validated?</summary>
<br>
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` validates your output manifest, 
so you discover mistakes when you build, not in a cryptic Chrome
alert later.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it detect permissions automatically?</summary>
<br>
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` statically analyzes your bundled
code, detects any required permissions and adds them to the manifest in the `dist` folder.
Any permissions in the source manifest are always included.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to copy/paste the package.json fields to the Manifest?</summary>
<br>
You can omit `manifest_version`, `version`, `name`, and
`description` from your source `manifest.json`. We'll fill them
out automatically from your `package.json`, if you use an npm
script to run Rollup. Just manage your version number in
`package.json` and it will reflect in your extension build.

Don't worry, any value in your source manifest will take over! üòâ
</details>

</div>

###  ‚≠êÔ∏è Reload Your Extension Automatically <a name = "features-reloader"></a>

<div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 10px;">

<details>
<summary>Does this mean I don't have to manually reload my extension during development?</summary>
<br>
Improve your development experience with our reloader! You won't have to reload your Chrome extension every time you make a change
to your code. We know what a pain it can be to forget and wonder, "Why isn't this working? üòü". 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it also reload the pages I am injecting content scripts?</summary>
<br>
Ever got the error `"Extension context invalidated"` in your
content script? That happens when the extension reloads but the
content script doesn't. Our reloader makes sure that doesn't
happen by reloading your content scripts when it reloads your
extension automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I enable the reloader?</summary>
<br>
If you include the helper plugin `simpleReloader` in your config,
when Rollup is in watch mode your background page will include an
auto-reloader script. This will reload your extension every time
Rollup produces a new build.
</details>

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Write Chrome Extensions In TypeScript <a name = "typescript"></a>

#### Includes chrome extension API types

If you use the
[`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript), you can write your Chrome extension in
TypeScript. That's right, it bundles the scripts in your manifest and in
your HTML script tags.

TypeScript definitions are included, so no need to install an
additional `@types` library!

---

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Use ES2015 Modules In Your Scripts <a name = "features-modules"></a>

Chrome extensions don't support modules in background and content
scripts. We've developed a
[module loader](#dynamic-import-wrapper) specifically for Chrome
extension scripts, so you can take advantage of Rollup's great
code splitting features.

---

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Plugins Take It To The Next Level <a name = "plugins"></a>

Take advantage of other great Rollup plugins to do awesome things
with your Chrome extensions!

Some of our favorites are:

- Write your extension in TS with
  [`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript)
- Import CSS in JS files with
  [`rollup-plugin-postcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-postcss)
- Zip your extension when you build with
  [`rollup-plugin-zip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-zip).
- Copy any assets not included in the manifest.json
  [`rollup-plugin-copy`](https://github.com/vladshcherbin/rollup-plugin-copy).

Two of our own plugins:

- Import a module as a string of code to use in
  `chrome.runtime.executeScript` with
  [`rollup-plugin-bundle-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-bundle-imports)
- Empty your output folder before a new build with
  [`rollup-plugin-empty-dir`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-empty-dir)
