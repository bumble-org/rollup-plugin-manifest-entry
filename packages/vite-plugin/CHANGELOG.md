## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 63d102f: Automatically ignores `build.outDir` for server HMR, so the file
  writer doesn't trigger a full reload.

  Fixes flaky HMR updates for content scripts; Tailwind should work fine now ðŸ¥³

- a1e2728: Fix isImporter recursion

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 86adbec: Sometimes during development, an extension page may open before the
  service worker has a chance to control fetch. The HTML file will load from the
  file system, but the script tag might load from the dev server. This PR adds a
  precontroller loader plugin to the dev server so that the extension page will
  reload and the fetch handler will get the real HTML file from the server.

- b83a4bd: Check for manifest assets first in the project root, then check in

  either dir.
